&emsp; &emsp; The [**Morris Animal Foundation**](https://www.morrisanimalfoundation.org/) started the [**Golden Retriever Lifetime Study (GRLS)**](https://www.morrisanimalfoundation.org/golden-retriever-lifetime-study) in 2012 to investigate the potential environmental, lifestyle, genetic and nutritional risk factors of major diseases including cancer in dogs. Over many years, vast amount of data has been collected from veterinarian records, dog ownersâ€™ questioners and genomic analysis for 3,000+ dogs. As a result, the GLRS is one of the largest canine health repositories in the United States. 

&emsp; &emsp; In this Github space, we will have several projects to make the GRLS data more Findable, Accessible, and Interoperable by biomedical scientists. Moreover, we will develop tutorials for data access together with easy-to-use bioinformatics workflows to enable more complete utilization of the data by the entire canine research community
